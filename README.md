# Feature-Selection-Qiime2

This repository describes the methods used to test different sci-kit learn feature selection methods as part of Qiime2 q2-classifier.

# Embedded Feature Selection

# 1. SelectFromModel Using Random Forest Estimator

The sklearn random Forest Classifier (RFC) was used as a base estimator in the feature selection step of my classification pipeline. RFC has a feature_importances_ attribute after fitting, which was used as the importance_getter parameter. For more details on sklearn's SelectFromModel, click on this link. For more details about sklearn's RFC, click on this other link. 

# 2. SelectFromModel Using Stochastic Gradient Descent Estimator

The sklearn stochastic gradient descent (SGD) classifier was used as a base estimator in the feature selection step of my classification pipeline. RFC has a feature_importances_ attribute after fitting, which was used as the importance_getter parameter. For more details about sklearn's SGDClassifier, click on this link. 

# 3. SelectFromModel Using Multinomial Naive Bayes Estimator

The sklearn multinomial naive bayes (MultinomialNB) classifier was used as a base estimator in the feature selection step of my classification pipeline. RFC has a feature_importances_ attribute after fitting, which was used as the importance_getter parameter. For more details about sklearn's MultinomialNB, click on this [link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html).
